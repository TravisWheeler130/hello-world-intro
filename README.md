# Overview

This project kicks off my personal software portfolio with a classic "Hello World" application. My goal is to establish a solid foundation for learning new programming languages and development environments.

This simple program demonstrates my ability to set up a working development environment, use version control with GitHub, and create professional documentation. Itâ€™s the first step in a series of projects that will showcase my growth and versatility as a software engineer.
